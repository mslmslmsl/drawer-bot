This chatbot has two files:

1. Use `getinfo.py` to pull artist info (name, bio, works) from the Drawer Artists page. The data is stored in `data.json`.
2. Use `chat.py` to ask an art advisor questions. This chatbot uses OpenAI's Chat API based on the context data in `data.json` and the user's prompts.
